            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The project follows the Waterfall methodology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> Understanding Splunk add-ons and threat intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Planning & Design:</strong> Developing a system architecture and data flow design.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Setting up data inputs, parsing and normalizing data, and building dashboards.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Validating data ingestion and threat detection logic in controlled environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Preparing the add-on for Splunk Enterprise Cloud and potential publication on Splunk Base.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved visibility into potential threats through diverse data sources.</li>
                <li>User-centric customization for industry-specific needs.</li>
                <li>Seamless integration with existing Splunk setups.</li>
                <li>Cost efficiency by centralizing threat intelligence tools.</li>
                <li>Reduced false positives through advanced correlation searches.</li>
            </ul>
